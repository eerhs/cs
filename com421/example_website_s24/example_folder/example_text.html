        <h1>COM 421 Writing Exercise Three</h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>General instructions for all writing exercises</h2>
        <p>Complete all the exercises in this document. Work independently. Outside assistance on this assignment is not allowed. If you need clarification on the instructions, please email me.</p>
        
        <h2>Instructions for Exercise Two</h2>
        <p>These problems ask you to think about different types of letters as well as style and document design principles we covered in class. Carefully read the instructions for each problem.</p>
        
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <p>I'll evaluate you on your ability to apply skills and approaches to letter writing and document design that we learned in class to address the issues in each problem. Now that you have your style homework back, try to avoid repeat style errors.</p>
        
        <h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
        <p>Completed assignments should be submitted no later than 1:50 p.m. on Tuesday, February 18th. Follow these instructions to the letter:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Put responses in a new file. Only include your responses, <strong>not the original scenarios and documents.</strong></li>
            <li>Label each question by number alone, in numerical order.</li>
            <li>Your file name should be your last name followed by "_Exercise3" (e.g. my file would be named "Roback_Exercise3").</li>
            <li>Your file should be in .docx format only.</li>
            <li>Send your file as an attachment to this address: aroback@iit.edu.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><em>Failure to follow any of the instructions will result in one warning</em>, followed by escalating grade reductions on subsequent assignments.</p>
        
        <p>Failure to submit the assignment before the deadline will result in a 10% grade reduction. If you fail to submit by midnight of the same day, you'll receive a grade of zero.</p>
