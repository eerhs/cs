    <h3 id="lifting-techniques">1. Mindful Lifting Techniques</h2>
    <p>One of the most critical aspects of moving is proper lifting technique. Learn how to bend your knees, engage your core, and use your legs, not your back, to lift heavy objects.

    <p>Our fleet of moving vehicles adheres to the highest safety standards. You'll learn how to inspect, maintain, and drive them responsibly. Additionally, our loading procedures prioritize stability and weight distribution, making sure every shipment is secure during transportation.</p>

    <h3 id="hazard-awareness">5. Hazard Awareness</h2>
    <p>Being vigilant about potential hazards is vital for a smooth moving process. We'll train you to identify and address potential risks, such as slippery floors, narrow passages, or unstable objects, to ensure a safe working environment for yourself and others.</p>

    <h3 id="regulations">6. Adhering to Regulations</h2>
    <p>As a reputable moving company, we strictly adhere to local, state, and federal regulations. Learn about safety guidelines, load restrictions, and other legal requirements to maintain our high standards of service and keep everyone safe.</p>

    <h3 id="communication-teamwork">7. Communication & Teamwork</h2>
    <p>Effective communication and teamwork are the pillars of our success. Discover how to communicate clearly, coordinate tasks, and support your fellow team members to foster a collaborative and secure work environment.</p>

    <h3 id="emergency-preparedness">8. Emergency Preparedness</h2>
    <p>While we prioritize prevention, accidents can still happen. <b>Be prepared to handle emergency situations efficiently and calmly,</b> knowing the appropriate procedures to follow and when to seek assistance.</p>

    <p>At Federal Van Lines, we take pride in our safety culture and the well-being of our team. Together, let's create an injury-free workplace where every member can thrive. Remember, safety isn't just a practiceâ€”it's a way of life.</p>
