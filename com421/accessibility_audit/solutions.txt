There are a few issues to deal with:

	* Text stored as image
	* Missing alt attribute
	* Nav is not in a list or the <nav> element
	* Skipped heading level
	* Use of <strong> for heading instead of heading element
	* Use of deprecated element (<b> for <strong>)
	

Visual issues:

	* Contrast with background color
	* Links impossible to read on black background
	* Headings are spaced equidistantly between blocks of content
	

Not on this page, but remember:

	* Do you have a caption on tables?
	* Have you checked for all of the deprecated HTML elements including <b>, <i>, and <u>?
	* Are you using semantic block elements instead of generic, e.g. <div id="nav">?
	* If you're using <em>, is it for vocal stress on text or just to make it italics? Use <cite> for titles and <strong> for warnings.
